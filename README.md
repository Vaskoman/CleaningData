This script performs the following tasks:
- 1. Installs the required packages
- 2. Downloads the .zip file required in a directory called **project**.
- 3. Extracts the data by reading directly from the text files provided in the different subfolders.
- 4. Uploads the *labels* (denoting activity) and *features* data (denoting the types of measurements performed).
- 5. Uploads the *test* and *train* measurements data.
- 6. Gives names to each measurement by changing the column names to be as names provided in the *features* file.
- 7. Combines the test and train measurements in one big dataframe. *Note that the script adds a variable that shows whether the specific measurement (row) belongs to the train or test data.*
- 8. Selects only for measurements of **Standard Deviation** and **Mean**.
- 9. Adds labels to this new dataset representing type of **activity** associated with each entry. This are obtained from the uploaded *labels* table.
- 10. Changes the names of the variabes measured (column names) so that they are easily readable. The punctuation and **()** signs are removed and replaced with underscores.
- 11. Rearranges the data so that the final table gives the mean measurement for each variable per subject and per activity.
- Also note that the script strives to save as much RAM as possible by removing temporary objects.
- The column names (variables) are very intuitive to comprehend. Note that X, Y or Z at the end of the variable name denotes direction.
